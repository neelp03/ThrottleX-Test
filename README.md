### 1. **Benchmark Setup**

#### **Environment**
- **Distributed System**: If you don't have access to multiple physical servers, you can use cloud instances (e.g., AWS EC2, GCP) or containers running on the same machine to simulate distributed nodes.
  - **Nodes**: 5 nodes, each with 4-core CPUs and 16GB of RAM.
  - **Orchestration**: Use Docker Compose to create a multi-node setup on a single machine if needed, or Kubernetes to orchestrate nodes if you're running in the cloud.

#### **Redis Backend**
- **Redis Configuration**: Redis should be fine-tuned for high performance, focusing on pipelining and key expiration optimization.
  - **Pipelining**: Ensure Redis commands are batched to reduce latency. This can be configured in your Redis client or through direct tuning of Redis itself.
  - **Key Expiration**: Configure efficient expiration policies for your rate-limiting keys in Redis to avoid excessive memory use.

#### **Traffic Load**
- **Simulating Traffic**: You can use load testing tools like **`wrk`**, **`vegeta`**, or **`k6`** to simulate a large volume of traffic (up to 1 million requests per second).
  - **`wrk` example**:
    ```bash
    wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://localhost:8080/endpoint
    ```
    - `-t12`: 12 threads
    - `-c400`: 400 concurrent connections
    - `-d30s`: Run the test for 30 seconds
  - You can adjust these parameters to simulate both **regular** traffic and **burst traffic** scenarios.
  
#### **Monitoring Tools**
- **Prometheus**: Use Prometheus to monitor ThrottleX metrics such as requests per second (RPS), latency, and memory usage. Ensure that Prometheus is scraping data frequently enough to capture high-traffic scenarios.
- **Grafana**: Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize real-time performance metrics from Prometheus. Key metrics to monitor:
  - Requests per second (RPS)
  - Redis latency
  - Request latency
  - Memory usage

### 2. **Stress Testing and Benchmark Results**

#### **1. Throughput – 1 Million Requests per Second**
- **Objective**: Measure if ThrottleX can handle 1 million requests per second across multiple nodes.
- **Testing**:
  1. Use the load testing tool (`wrk`, `vegeta`, `k6`) to simulate 1 million RPS.
  2. Monitor **Prometheus** for RPS, and verify in **Grafana** that the requests are distributed across the nodes.
  3. Simulate burst traffic (e.g., temporarily increase RPS to 1.2 million) and observe if ThrottleX maintains performance.
  
  **Expected Results**:
  - Consistent 1 million RPS across nodes without significant performance degradation.
  - ThrottleX should handle burst traffic up to 1.2 million RPS.

#### **2. Latency – Sub-Millisecond Response Times**
- **Objective**: Measure the latency for handling requests.
- **Testing**:
  1. Track **Redis latency** and **request latency** using Prometheus.
  2. Ensure Redis pipelining is optimized to minimize round trips to the database.
  
  **Expected Results**:
  - **Average Redis latency**: ~0.7 ms
  - **Average request latency**: ~0.8 ms

#### **3. Memory Efficiency – 30% Lower Memory Usage**
- **Objective**: Test the memory efficiency of ThrottleX under high load.
- **Testing**:
  1. Monitor the memory usage of each node using Prometheus.
  2. Implement **goroutine pooling** and **custom memory pools** in ThrottleX, then compare memory usage to a traditional rate limiter (if applicable).
  
  **Expected Results**:
  - A 30% reduction in memory usage compared to traditional rate-limiting approaches, especially under high load.

#### **4. Error Rates – Less Than 0.001%**
- **Objective**: Ensure ThrottleX maintains a very low error rate, even under peak load.
- **Testing**:
  1. Monitor the error rate using a custom Prometheus metric that tracks failed requests.
  2. Ensure that **adaptive rate limiting** and the **circuit breaker** pattern are properly configured.
  
  **Expected Results**:
  - Less than 0.001% of requests should fail or be throttled unnecessarily.

### 3. **How to Run These Tests in a Local/Cloud Environment**

#### **Local Setup with Docker**:
You can use Docker Compose to set up multiple nodes locally. Here's a basic `docker-compose.yml` for testing with Redis and ThrottleX:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  throttlex:
    image: throttlex-image
    deploy:
      replicas: 5  # Simulate 5 nodes
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
    networks:
      - backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  redis:
    image: redis
    networks:
      - backend
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

networks:
  backend:
    driver: bridge
```

Run:
```bash
docker-compose up --scale throttlex=5
```

#### **Cloud Setup (AWS/GCP)**:
If you prefer cloud-based testing, you can spin up EC2 or GCP instances for each node, deploy Redis and ThrottleX, and simulate traffic between them.

### 4. **Analyzing and Visualizing Results**

- **Prometheus Metrics**: 
  - Use **PromQL queries** to measure the metrics you want to benchmark, like throughput and latency.
  - Example query for **requests per second**:
    ```promql
    rate(requests_total[1m])
    ```

- **Grafana**:
  - Set up dashboards for visualizing metrics in real-time.
  - Use panels for **requests per second**, **latency**, and **memory usage**.
